Julia Overview
==============

Presentation slides introducing the various features of Julia, as well as PDFs with resources for learning more.

The three components of this repo are:
- Eubank_Julia.pdf: a presentation given at Vanderbilt on why we need another programming language and what Julia has to offer.
- Eubank_JuliaResources.pdf: Resources for getting started with Julia, including:
    - How to install Julia, and how to set up a good editor.  
    - Where to go for Julia help.
    - Where to find interactive tutorials AND videos of Julia Computing staff working through tutorials.
    - Amazing cheat-sheets including syntax comparisons with Matlab and Python.
    - How to get Julia to work on the Vanderbilt ACCRE computing cluster.
    - An overview of the package ecosystem -- where to go for all your needs.
- Eubank_PassByReference.pdf: A lot of people coming to Julia from R may be unfamiliar with a pass-by-reference language. I've found many programmers take this knowledge for granted, so it doesn't come up in tutorials, but it's super important and if its not explained, super confusing. **If you are primarily an R user, please make sure to check out the Pass By Reference pdf** on the principles of pass-by-referenceÂ programming languages.
